I am a PhD candidate at the School of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, where I am deeply engaged in exploring the intricacies of tracking problems within large-scale video data. My research primarily focuses on the fields of re-identification, multi-object detection, and tracking, striving to contribute innovative solutions to these complex areas.
